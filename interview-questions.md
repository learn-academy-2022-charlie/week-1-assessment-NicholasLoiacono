# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: git is the software that programmers use to create projects and to collaboratively work on projects together with paired programmers. This software is what is pushed to Github, which is a central storage area for programmers projects and can be used to showcase past projects to employers as a portfolio. 

  Researched answer: Git stands for Global Information Tracker, and it was created in 2005. Git allows for multiple people to contribute to the same code base, thus allowing many people to share their code with one another. One of the best things about Git is its branching capabilities that help to manage the different versions of code uploaded to a repository.
  Github is a code hosting platform. This is where the git software will be uploaded, and this is where the multiple people working on the same project will be able to pull git off of. It essentially lets people work on projects together from anywhere in the world, making a programmers job able to be 100% remote. 



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: &&, ||, !
  The && (AND) operator will check if two statements are true together and will return true, if one or both of the statements are not true it will return false. The || (OR) operator will check to see if at least one statement is true (one OR the other) and return the word true, but if both statements are not true it will return the word false. The ! (NOT) operator will reverse the outcome of the boolean result, which means if the result would normally be true and ! (NOT) is inserted then the result will end up being false instead (and vice versa). 

  Researched answer: The operators have specific functions assigned to them, this includes; "&&" which will take a higher precedence than the "||" operator, but when "!" is used it will change the outcome to whatever you want it to be (if you use it properly). Basically, saying that if you have an outcome of true you can change it to false by adding just this symbol "!" when put into the right place in the code. 



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: The index is what will tell you where a specific item is located in an array. The items it will refer to will be in a string or an element inside an array. The difference is that index will locate the placement of an item (starting from the placement of 0) and value is the content of an item. 

  Researched answer: Index can be used in both arrays and loops. In arrays, it will tell you the placement of an item or when you ask what is in a certain place it will give the name of what is there (i.e. Jim, John, Steve; when you ask what is in positioin 2 it will return Steve because it indexes 0 as Jim, 1 as John, and 2 as Steve). In a loop, it will be a sort of starting value in a "for" loop value. The difference between index and value is that index is a read only type of output (a statement, if you will, of where an item is or what is in the numeric placement of an item), while value is what the content of something is (i.e. a string, a number, pieces of text, or even functions, etc.).



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: An iteration is when you perform something multiple times or until a condition is met. This is commonly referred to in loops, as an example you could want to multiply all numbers in an array by 4 and until that condition is met the iteration will continue to perform its task until the loop has met its condition. 

  Researched answer: An iteration is the task that needs to be performed. For example, in a "for" loop when you add "++" or "--" to the operation this would be considered an iteration. This iteration will either perform increments or decrements based on which operator you choose to use.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming is when you have one driver and one navigator (or you could have multiple navigators working together or taking turns navigating different sections for the one driver). The driver is the person that has the code editor open (and sharing their screen if working remotely) so that they can type everything the navigator says. The navigator will be like a passenger in a car giving directions, they will tell the driver what exactly to write and do while entering code into the code editor. This gives both (or all) individuals an opportunity to see the code being written and to talk about what is being written together.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is typically a team of individuals (as little as two) that work on one computer (or one workstation) to develop code. There is usually a time limit set for when a driver and a navigator switch roles in the pair programming process. Pair programming helps code faster, reduce mistakes (because of the multiple sets of eyes), use different coding techniques (usually the most efficient way), and dispurse knowledge amongst individuals (or a company) because everyone has different levels of knowledge and expertise under their belts.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: take in one or more functions as an arguement. It can also return functions as their results instead.

2. Jest: is a testing process to basically test if the framework of JavaScript is working properly.

3. Objects: are their own devices with their own properties. It's similar to having an object like a pen, but that pen has properties like being long, or bent, or black. The object is the collection of the different properties/methods.

4. Method: is part of the properties talked about above in "objects." It is what is inside the objects (i.e. variables and functions).

5. Classes: are essentially the blueprint for objects, they are their own function. Based on my current knowledge, I have only seen classes created in CSS files and referenced in HTML files.
